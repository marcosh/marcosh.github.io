I am a software developer, currently working at [Tweag](https://www.tweag.io).

I love to learn, experiment and try new things. I am particularly interested in various programming paradigms, design patterns and software architecture.

As time goes by I'm becoming more and more interested in functional programming, category theory and type theory, especially for their role in connecting pure mathematic with computer science and software design.

Beyond that, I love animals, depressing music, and reading books, from comics to novels to technical ones. I also adore chocolate and I collect chocolate wrappers (see [my wrappers collection][chocolates]).
